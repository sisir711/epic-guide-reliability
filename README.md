# Epic Guide to Service Reliability Engineering 

Service Reliability Engineering is an emerging skill of popular interest that allows creators and makers to focus on what matters. By completing this Epic Guide on SRE, you will be able to apply system-level approaches to optimizing the reliability of your software for common cloud workload types.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Why Service Reliability Matters** Moving reliability from an implicit perception to a very explicit engineering construct is essential to everyday maker tasks.
- **Building your Service Catalog** To know what we're dealing with, we'll first learn how to catalog your services effectively - after all, every service and its context is unique.
- **Defining Service Reliability Goals** All goals are equal, but some are more equal than others. We learn how to identify, prioritize and define these goals to build a shared context among your service stakeholders.
- **Managing Error Budgets and Human Toil** Errors are good and transmit critical information about the nature of the underlying service failure mode. We learn how to manage these error budgets and consequently plan effective toil reduction campaigns.
- **Optimizing Incident Response** All planning can be rendered ineffective if it's not available at the time of necessity. We learn how to augment and build incident response into a practice that incorporates feedback from the above.
- **Running a Blameless Postmortem** We learn about improving shared context about failure traces in a blameless manner is helpful to building more reliable systems.

## Applications

Once the Epic Guide on Service Reliability Engineering is completed, you should see significant improvements in workplace productivity, aspire for wider scope of play for your reliability engineering skills and improve transferability of learnings across domains of interest.
